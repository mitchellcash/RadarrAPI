RadarrAPI [![AppVeyor](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/AeonLucid/radarrapi/master.svg?maxAge=60&style=flat-square)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AeonLucid/radarrapi)
===================

*Deployment of RadarrAPI is done manually to https://radarr.aeonlucid.com/ by [@AeonLucid](https://github.com/AeonLucid)*.

This is the services API of [https://github.com/galli-leo/Radarr](https://github.com/galli-leo/Radarr). The API is created from scratch and not based on [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr) because it's not open-source.

The most important task of this API is to provide auto-updating to Radarr.

## Development

If you want to work on **RadarrAPI**, make sure you have [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) installed.
